# WSO2 API Manager — Stripe Monetization Extension

A Stripe monetization integration for WSO2 API Manager 4.x. Enables API providers to charge subscribers for API access using Stripe's hosted Checkout flow and recurring subscription billing.

---

## What You Can Do

- **Stripe Checkout for subscriptions** — When a subscriber selects a monetized API tier in the DevPortal, APIM redirects them to a Stripe-hosted payment page.
- **Billing Portal for subscribers** — Subscribers can open a Stripe-hosted Billing Portal to update payment methods, view invoices, and manage or cancel their subscription.
- **Automatic subscription lifecycle** — Stripe webhook events (payment succeeded, failed, or action required) automatically block or unblock APIM subscriptions to match the current billing state.
- **Fixed-rate and metered billing** — Set a flat recurring price per tier, or report per-request usage to Stripe for usage-based pricing.
- **Multi-tenant support** — Each WSO2 tenant uses its own Stripe platform key and webhook secret, keeping billing data isolated between tenants.

---

## Compatibility

**This version (v1.6.0) supports WSO2 API Manager 4.5.0 and above.** For older APIM versions, use the corresponding earlier release.

| Extension Version | WSO2 API Manager Version |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1.0.x | 3.0.0 |
| 1.1.x | 3.1.0 – 3.2.0 |
| 1.2.x | 4.0.0 |
| 1.3.x – 1.5.x | 4.1.0 |
| **1.6.x** | **4.5.0** |

## Architecture Overview

The extension uses **Stripe Connect** with a platform-and-connected-account model:

- The **WSO2 tenant admin** owns the Stripe platform account. Its secret key is used to authenticate all Stripe API calls on behalf of connected accounts.
- Each **API provider** (publisher) has a Stripe connected account. Checkout sessions, subscriptions, and customers are created on this connected account, not on the platform account.
- **Subscribers** are represented as Stripe Customer objects on the API provider's connected account, stored in `AM_MONETIZATION_SHARED_CUSTOMERS`.

This separation means billing is isolated per API provider. A subscriber's payment method and invoices on one provider's Stripe account are invisible to other providers.

## Repository Structure

```
wso2-am-stripe-plugin/
  stripe-plugin/      OSGi bundle — core monetization logic
  stripe-service/     WAR — Stripe event receiver and DevPortal helper endpoints
```

---

## Components

### 1. stripe-plugin

This is the primary business logic module. It implements the WSO2 `Monetization` SPI and two workflow executors for subscription creation and deletion.

---

### 2. stripe-service

Exposes a REST API at `https://<host>:9443/api/am/stripe/`.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/webhook` | POST | Receives Stripe push events. Verifies the `Stripe-Signature` header, resolves the tenant from the `?tenantDomain=` query parameter, and dispatches to the appropriate handler. |
| `/checkout-url` | GET | Returns the pending Stripe Checkout URL for a given workflow reference. Used by the DevPortal UI to redirect the subscriber to Stripe's hosted payment page. |
| `/complete-session` | GET | Browser-redirect fallback path. After checkout, Stripe redirects the browser to `success_url?session_id={id}`. This endpoint approves the APIM workflow if the primary webhook delivery was delayed. |
| `/portal-url` | GET | Creates a Stripe Billing Portal session for a given APIM subscription and returns the hosted URL. The subscriber uses this to update payment methods, view invoices, and manage their subscription. |
| `/oidc/callback` | GET | OIDC authorization-code callback. Exchanges the code for a token, stores the authenticated username in the session, and redirects back to the original URL. |

### OIDC Authentication

The `/checkout-url` and `/portal-url` endpoints require the caller to be authenticated. If no valid session exists, the request is redirected for OIDC login, then back to the original URL after authentication.

The OAuth2 service provider (`apim_stripe_service`) is registered automatically via the Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) API on the first OIDC request. After registration, apply the following manual configuration in the Management Console under the `apim_stripe_service` SP:

1. Enable **SaaS Application**
2. **Claim Configuration** → set Subject Claim URI to `http://wso2.org/claims/username`
3. **Local & Outbound Authentication Configuration** → enable **Use tenant domain in local subject identifier**

**Stripe events handled:**

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Approves the pending APIM subscription workflow; activates the subscription |
| `checkout.session.expired` | Marks the session `EXPIRED` in the DB; rejects the pending workflow |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | Unblocks the APIM subscription if it was previously blocked |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Blocks the APIM subscription |
| `invoice.payment_action_required` | Blocks the APIM subscription (requires subscriber SCA/3DS re-authentication) |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Blocks the APIM subscription when the Stripe status transitions to `past_due` or `unpaid` |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Removes the APIM subscription and deletes the associated monetization record when the Stripe subscription is cancelled externally |

## Subscription Creation Workflow

```
Subscriber (DevPortal)
  │
  │  1. Subscribes to a monetized API tier
  ▼
APIM (StripeSubscriptionCreationWorkflowExecutor.execute)
  │
  │  2. Loads the API's ConnectedAccountKey and the tier's Stripe Price ID
  │  3. Creates a Stripe Checkout Session (SUBSCRIPTION mode) on the connected account
  │  4. Saves the session to AM_STRIPE_CHECKOUT_SESSIONS (status: PENDING)
  │  5. Returns HTTP redirect URL to the DevPortal
  ▼
Stripe Checkout (hosted payment page)
  │
  │  6. Subscriber enters payment details and confirms
  ▼
Two parallel paths:
  │
  ├── 7a. Stripe fires checkout.session.completed webhook
  │         → WebhookApiServiceImpl verifies HMAC signature
  │         → Calls WorkflowExecutorFactory.complete(APPROVED)
  │         → APIM activates subscription (status: UNBLOCKED)
  │
  └── 7b. Stripe redirects browser to success_url?session_id=...
            → CompleteSessionApiServiceImpl (GET /complete-session)
            → Idempotent: skips if already COMPLETED
            → Calls WorkflowExecutorFactory.complete(APPROVED)
```

---

## Subscription Deletion Workflow

```
Publisher or Subscriber initiates unsubscription in APIM
  │
  ▼
StripeSubscriptionDeletionWorkflowExecutor.complete
  │  Looks up Stripe subscription ID from AM_MONETIZATION_SUBSCRIPTIONS
  │  Cancels the Stripe subscription via Subscription.cancel(requestOptions)
  │  requestOptions uses per-request API key + setStripeAccount(connectedAccountKey)
  │  Deletes row from AM_MONETIZATION_SUBSCRIPTIONS
  ▼
APIM removes the subscription record
```

---

## Billing Events Lifecycle

```
Stripe (recurring billing)
  │
  │  Fires webhook to https://<host>:9443/api/am/stripe/webhook?tenantDomain=<tenant>
  ▼
WebhookApiServiceImpl
  │
  │  Resolves tenant → loads per-tenant webhook secret from tenant-conf.json
  │  Verifies Stripe-Signature (HMAC-SHA256, 5-minute replay tolerance)
  │
  ├── invoice.payment_succeeded  →  unblock APIM subscription
  ├── invoice.payment_failed     →  block  APIM subscription
  ├── invoice.payment_action_required  →  block (SCA required)
  └── customer.subscription.updated (past_due/unpaid)  →  block

  Block/unblock path:
    ApiMgtDAO.updateSubscriptionStatus(id, "BLOCKED"|"UNBLOCKED")
    Derives tenant from API provider name via MultitenantUtils.getTenantDomain(providerName)
    Fires SubscriptionEvent via APIUtil.sendNotification → gateway cache invalidated
```

---

## Multi-tenant Isolation

Each WSO2 tenant registers a **separate webhook URL** in their Stripe Dashboard, including their tenant domain as a query parameter:

```
https://apim.example.com:9443/api/am/stripe/webhook?tenantDomain=tenant-a.com
https://apim.example.com:9443/api/am/stripe/webhook?tenantDomain=tenant-b.com
```

The webhook secret and platform account key for each tenant are read from that tenant's `tenant-conf.json` via `APIUtil.getTenantConfig(tenantDomain)`. An event delivered with a forged `tenantDomain` value will fail HMAC verification because the attacker cannot possess that tenant's Stripe signing secret.

Tenant resolution for block/unblock notifications does not rely on `PrivilegedCarbonContext` (which is always `carbon.super` in the webhook WAR). Instead, the tenant is derived from the API provider name stored in the subscription record.
